## Overview

OneDayIn is a full stack (MERN) group project developed with a group of 3. We created a full stack web application that will allow users to CRUD (create, read, update and delete) functionality on the application itself. The app allows users to view a city where they want to spend a day and view/add a recommendation to the city as well. They will be able to delete their comments, recommendations, as well as add a rating on otherâ€™s recommended places too. The backend of the app was developed with Node.js and Express framework, and the database used is MongoDB. The frontend was developed with React.js framework.
